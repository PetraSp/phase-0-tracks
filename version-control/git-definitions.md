# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control enables to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files. If needed, developers can access past versions for reference and roll back to a previous commit. It helps to protect software because if someone makes a mistake a developer can always roll back. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is an independent line of development of a project. It enables to experiment with a code without affecting a code base.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in Git. It takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. A good commit message should explain what was done in the commit, and contains an author (name, email address) and a time stamp.

* What is a merge conflict?
It occurs when we changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches we're merging together. Git will mark the file as having a conflict. The conflict has to be solved before we can continue our work.
